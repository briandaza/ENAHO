# ENAHO
Stata do-file scripts to process the Peruvian National Household Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Hogares)
Please treat all of this as if it were preliminar stuff: Look with caution.

Sebastian Sardon has put togheter codes to download and clean this data as well (https://github.com/PeruData/ENAHO), I didn't have 
to chance to look over those scripts and do-files in detail yet.

If you are not me, consider checking Sebastian's code as well. Very likely, his codes might be more useful for you than my codes.  

E-mail me (bdaza@umich.edu) if you find important inconsistencies or feedback.
